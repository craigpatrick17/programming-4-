Reviewer 1:
Your file worked very well in both of my emulators. I ran it with a 5s and an iPad. The buttons worked, and the picuture 
place holders showed up. my one suggestion is to make sure you are consistent with your sizing of pictures and navigation.
Some of your nav windows have percentages while others have pure number sizes. I would suggest keeping them in percentages as 
it makes it easier to adjust to different sizes of the windows. You can also organize your code to make it easier to read. An example is putting all of the add functions at the end of the code, or just after you create each individual var. Consistency is key in these though. Overall great job! Works well and looks good!
